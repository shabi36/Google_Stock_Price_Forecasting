# 📊 **Google Stock Price Prediction **  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility and randomness of financial markets. This project applies **time series analysis** and **machine learning** 🤖 to predict **Google's stock prices** based on historical data. By analyzing past trends and patterns, the model aims to provide insights into future price movements.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The main goal of this project is to build a **time series forecasting model** that predicts **Google stock prices** 📈 with high accuracy, helping traders and investors make informed decisions.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **historical stock market data** for Google, including:  
💰 **Open Price** – Opening price of the stock for a given day.  
📈 **High & Low Prices** – The highest and lowest stock prices during the day.  
🔻 **Closing Price** – The final stock price at market close.  
📊 **Adjusted Close Price** – Adjusted for dividends and stock splits.  
📦 **Trading Volume** – Number of shares traded on a particular day.  

The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing price values, and converting timestamps into a structured format.  

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**  
Various **time series forecasting** techniques are explored:  
⚡ **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
📉 **Exponential Smoothing**  
📊 **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – Deep Learning Approach**  
🔥 **XGBoost & Random Forest Regressor**  

Models are evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score** to ensure accuracy.  

## 🔄 **Workflow**  
🔹 **Data Preprocessing**  
   - 📥 Load and clean the dataset.  
   - ⏳ Convert timestamps to a structured format.  
   - 📏 Normalize stock prices for better model performance.  
   - ✂️ Split data into **training and testing sets**.  

🔹 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - 🏋️ Train multiple forecasting models.  
   - 📊 Compare model performance using evaluation metrics.  
   - 🔍 Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.  

🔹 **Prediction & Visualization**  
   - 📈 Forecast future stock prices.  
   - 📌 Visualize historical vs. predicted trends.  

## 📈 **Results & Future Improvements**  
🏆 The final model provides **accurate stock price predictions**, helping investors and analysts understand market trends. Future enhancements may include:  
🔹 **Incorporating Sentiment Analysis** – Using news & social media sentiment to refine predictions.  
🔹 **Real-Time Forecasting** – Updating predictions dynamically with live stock market data.  
🔹 **Advanced Deep Learning Models** – Implementing transformers & attention mechanisms for better accuracy.  

## 🚀 **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning & time series analysis** can be used to **predict stock prices**, providing **valuable insights** for investors. While stock markets remain unpredictable, data-driven forecasting can help identify trends and make informed decisions. 📊💡
